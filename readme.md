# The Honeycomb Web

## Introduction

The basic concept of the Honeycomb Web is to remake what we call "the Web" from scratch.
Nowdays, people use normal Web Browsers to load HTML/JS/CSS based webpages. 

But we thought that we could be able to remake the concept of the Web, much more securely/effectively, but also very differently.
The conclusion of this project will be a demo of the Honeycomb Web, which will require users to be fixed in a hexagon-shaped network. See below documentation for more information about the concept.

## How it works

The Honeycomb Web binds 6 network users into one group of Hexagon.
Let's call this a Hex.

Between these users inside the same Hex, they can search each other's hidden local files. 
These hidden local files consist of "spge" files(for more information on spge files, see SPGE files below) of static webpages.

When a user requests Data, the request is sent to the Class 1, or the 3 closest users. 
Since 3 Hexes meet on a single edge(where users reside), a single point(user) will be connected to 3 users, and they will be the Class 1.
